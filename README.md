This project is a 2D escape game developed using Python and the Pygame library, built upon the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Technical Details & Engineering Competencies

Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP):   Designed characters, obstacles, and power-ups using modular classes to ensure a sustainable and scalable codebase.

Game Loop & State Management:   Implemented a state machine logic to manage different game phases (Start, Play, Game Over) along with Frame Per Second (FPS) control for a smooth user experience.

Dynamic Collision Algorithms:   Integrated collision detection algorithms based on the Pygame Sprite class to detect real-time interactions between the player and moving obstacles.

Power-up Mechanics:     Engineered custom ability systems that dynamically update in-game object lists, enhancing the player's survival strategy.

Data & Score Management:   Developed a dynamic scoring system and data tracking mechanism that correlates with increasing difficulty levels during gameplay.
